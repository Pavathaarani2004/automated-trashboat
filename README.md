Automated Trash Boat Using Object Detection 

The Automated Trash Boat is an AI-powered solution designed to combat water pollution by identifying and collecting floating debris from water bodies. Using the YOLO (You Only Look Once)algorithm and the COCO dataset, the boat performs real-time object detection to locate trash like plastic bottles and cans. Once detected, the system navigates the boat to the debris and collects it using an automated mechanism.  
This project showcases the practical application of AI and machine learning in addressing environmental challenges, reflecting my expertise in object detection and automation.
